autofit-larger=90%x90%

# Do not close the window on exit.
#keep-open=yes

# Do not wait with showing the video window until it has loaded. (This will
# resize the window once video is loaded. Also always shows a window with
# audio.)
#force-window=immediate

# Disable the On Screen Controller (OSC).
#osc=no

# Keep the player window on top of all other windows.

vo=gpu

# Specify fast video rendering preset (for --vo=<gpu|gpu-next> only)
# Recommended for mobile devices or older hardware with limited processing power
#profile=fast

# Specify high quality video rendering preset (for --vo=<gpu|gpu-next> only)
# Offers superior image fidelity and visual quality for an enhanced viewing
# experience on capable hardware
profile=high-quality

# Force video to lock on the display's refresh rate, and change video and audio
# speed to some degree to ensure synchronous playback - can cause problems
# with some drivers and desktop environments.
#video-sync=display-resample

# Enable hardware decoding if available. Often, this does not work with all
# video outputs, but should work well with default settings on most systems.
# If performance or energy usage is an issue, forcing the vdpau or vaapi VOs
# may or may not help.

##################
# audio settings #
##################

# Specify default audio device. You can list devices with: --audio-device=help
# The option takes the device string (the stuff between the '...').
#audio-device=alsa/default

# Do not filter audio to keep pitch when changing playback speed.
#audio-pitch-correction=no

# Output 5.1 audio natively, and upmix/downmix audio with a different format.
#audio-channels=5.1
# Disable any automatic remix, _if_ the audio output accepts the audio format.
# of the currently played file. See caveats mentioned in the manpage.
# (The default is "auto-safe", see manpage.)

# Play Finnish audio if available, fall back to English otherwise.

# If the file seems to be valid UTF-8, prefer UTF-8.
# (You can add '+' in front of the codepage to force it.)
